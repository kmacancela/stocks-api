# README

First version of a game web application where users can start with a balance, depending on difficulty, search and buy stocks with the help of Alpha Vantage API (https://www.alphavantage.co/). This API fetches real data based on month and year of each stock. Users can choose up to 5 stocks and they will find out if they made or lost money when done. The second half of this web application is still getting built. Stay tuned for version 2.0 of this web application. This app was built with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQLite, and Alpha Vantage API.
